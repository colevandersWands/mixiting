# HackYourFuture Belgium: The Forkable Code School

## Talk format

to be determined, short talk or workshop make the most sense.

## Audience level

will depend on the format. a short talk would be all, a workshop would require a bit of github/similar experience

## pitch

Something is missing in the world of open computing education.  Something between an online learning platforms (FreeCodeCamp, Khan Academy) and full Learning Management Systems (Canvas, Moodle).  What's missing is a lean, accessible way to manage anything from a study group to a full coding school using only the tools of the trade. No more, no less.
Come learn how we use open source workflows and tools to run HackYourFuture Belgium.  And maybe hack your own future while you're at it :)

this is the part that is likely overkill. they said 20 bullet points, but this is a bit more involved than this.  and wouldn't work well as a short description on the site

## bio

Hello. I like to quietly do good work behind the scenes.  But from time to time it's nice to pop out and share what we're learning here in Brussels.

I don't think of me as a developer, and sometimes that's very helpful for teaching code.

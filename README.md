# HackYourFuture Belgium: The Forkable Code School

## Talk format

to be determined, short talk or workshop make the most sense.

## Audience level

will depend on the format. a short talk would be all, a workshop would require a bit of github/similar experience

## pitch

> reset to 300

Something is missing in open computing education.  Something between an online learning platform and a full Learning Management System.
Come learn how HackYourFuture Belgium manages 40+ students at a time with with (almost) nothing but a GitHub account and standard collaborative workflows.

## description

## bio

Hello. I like to quietly do good work behind the scenes.  But from time to time it's nice to pop out and share what we're learning here in Brussels.

I don't think of me as a developer, and sometimes that's very helpful for teaching code.

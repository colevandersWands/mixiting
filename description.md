# HackYourFuture Belgium: The Forkable Code School

Something is missing in the world of open computing education.  Something between an online learning platforms (FreeCodeCamp, Khan Academy) and full Learning Management Systems (Canvas, Moodle).  What's missing is a lean, accessible way to manage anything from a study group to a full coding school using only the tools of the trade. No more, no less.

Come learn how we use open source workflows and tools to run HackYourFuture Belgium.  And maybe hack your own future while you're at it :)

## Part 0: Open, Useful, Usable, Used

* ["Open knowledge is what open data becomes when itâ€™s useful, usable and used"](https://okfn.org/opendata/)
* "Open education is what happens when open educational resources are useful, usable and used"

## Part 1: Forkable Education

* Open Source Educational Resources are not by default Open Education: [Open Source !== Open Education](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019/blob/master/5-open-source-open-education.md)
* Forkability:  The barriers to entry between clicking the "fork" button, and adapting/applying the resource to your context
* Open Source only become Open Education when it's forkability is within the means/expertise of participating educators and students: [Agency](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019#agency), [Ownership](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019#ownership)

## Part 2: Measure accessiblity, not achievements

* To be useful, education must help those who need it most, and who are not served by existing options (or do not have access to them)
* There will always be a handful of students that do very well no matter how you teach or manage your course
* Measure and publicize your success by the progress of your least advanced students, not the success of your most advanced students

## Part 3: How we HYF

* Low barrier of entry - get started with nothing more than a forked & configured class repo: [template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-repo-template), [example `class-7`](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-7), [example `class-8`](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/class-8). (and of course, some students and teachers :)
* Quality learning resources all one fork away: [interactive code-alongs embedded in class slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/incremental-development/week-1), explorables ([Inspecting the DOM](https://hackyourfuture.be/inspecting-the-dom) & [Array Methods](https://hackyourfuture.be/array-methods)), and [aggregated study references](https://awesome.hackyourfuture.be)
* Incrementally adaptable curriculum - A [tested curriculum](https://curriculum.hackyourfuture.be) (v 2.0 under development) composed of one repository per module.  You can easily configure your class repos to add/remove modules, to read from your fork, or from any other repository.
* Accessible workflows - Composed entirely out of conventional collaborative workflows, classwork is easy to manage. This also ensures students develop strong habits simply by interacting with course materials, and [by submitting their homework](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/homework-submission) - [Context is content!](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019/blob/master/3-context-is-content.md).
* Forkable Administration infrastructure (still under development) - Manage class & event schedules, coach & student profiles, and keep an overview of each student's progress. Just fork, configure and deploy!  Most of the student monitoring is done by using the GitHub api, the rest is coaches and admins directly in the platform. (the app is developed with the same technologies, at the same level as the final project)

## Part 4: What's your hack?

* Education needs to fit your context.  What are your community's needs? short-comings? strengths? Setting constructive constraints on your project is the first step to success.
* Your students: what's their experience level coming in? what should they be able to do by the end? how can your course format complement their lives?
* Teaching capacity: will you have experienced teachers availale? industry professionals? or is this a peer study course?
* Funding: do you have access to funding for a coordinator/educational-director? for classrooms, materials and transportation?
* Core team: what skills and experience do you have in your core team (technical, administrative, communications)? How can use adapt the course to play to your strengths?

## Part 5: Get started!

* Come hang out after the talk, we can help each other get started.

> notes to the board

* This topic would work either as a short talk, or as a workshop.  I am comfortable doing either
  * as a short talk it would be the main ideas behind forkable education, how we do it at HYF Be, and how to get started on your own. (with a call to come talk afterwards).  The talk would be for all audiences
  * as a workshop it would be a short presentation followed by a guided walk-through of how we manage class. Giving everyone a chance to try setting up their own HYF class.  We are writing a complete guide for how to do this that will be ready before April.  This format would require experience with github, and some html/javascript.
* I haven't given this talk previously, but did give a similar one last year: [Fosdem Archive](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/js_teaching_tool/),  [slide-show and write-up](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019)
* I have previously presented in French at Sett-Namur, though this though was not recorded: [slides](https://blocks-to-text.github.io/sett-namur-19) (french), [write-up](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/top) (english).  And will present again this year - [Un pas d'avance](https://www.sett-namur.be/activity/apprentissage-de-la-programmation-toujours-avoir-un-pas-davance/), [Inclure l'iInformatiques](https://www.sett-namur.be/activity/inclure-linformatique-dans-toutes-les-disciplines-trucs-et-astuces/)
* And gave a smaller talk on Open Source Software for educators at EduCode: [Slides](https://colevanderswands.github.io/educode-19)
* This talk proposal is based on how we run HackYourFuture Belgium.  Some of the content and infrastructure mentioned in this proposal is still under development, but should be presentable by April.  In the mean-time we have a working proof of concept with 30 students who began this January, and 60 more by the end of the year.
* Personal credentials: I've been learning how to use open-source/github to run coding classes for over 3 years
* There would be no exceptional technical requirements. Just a browser & wifi, slides and examples/demos will all be live web-sites

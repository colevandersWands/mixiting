> notes to the board

* I haven't given this talk previously, but did give a similar one last year: [Fosdem Archive](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/js_teaching_tool/),  [slide-show and write-up](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019)
* I have previously presented in French at Sett-Namur, though this though was not recorded: [slides](https://blocks-to-text.github.io/sett-namur-19) (french), [write-up](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/top) (english).  And will present again this year - [Un pas d'avance](https://www.sett-namur.be/activity/apprentissage-de-la-programmation-toujours-avoir-un-pas-davance/), [Inclure l'iInformatiques](https://www.sett-namur.be/activity/inclure-linformatique-dans-toutes-les-disciplines-trucs-et-astuces/)
* And gave a smaller talk on Open Source Software for educators at EduCode: [Slides](https://colevanderswands.github.io/educode-19)
* This talk proposal is based on how we run HackYourFuture Belgium.  Some of the content and infrastructure mentioned in this proposal is still under development, but should be presentable by April.  In the mean-time we have a working proof of concept with 30 students who began this January, and 60 more by the end of the year.
* Personal credentials: I've been learning how to use open-source/github to run coding classes for over 3 years
* There would be no exceptional technical requirements. Just a browser & wifi, slides and examples/demos will all be live web-sites

> notes to the board

* This talk proposal is based on how we run HackYourFuture Belgium.  Some of the content and infrastructure mentioned in this proposal is still under development, but should be presentable by April.  In the mean-time we have a working proof of concept with 30 students who began this January, and 60 more by the end of the year.
* This topic would work either as a short talk, or as a workshop (50 minutes of just listening to this could be a bit dull).  I am equally comfortable doing either
  * as a short talk it would basically be a slide show with some demos and links for people to follow along. And a call to come talk afterwards.  The 20 min talk would be for all audiences
  * as a workshop it would be a short presentation followed by a guided walk-through of how to set up your own HYF class. With plenty of pauses, instructions, and guidance for participants.  We are writing a complete step-by-step guide for how to do this that will be ready before April.  This format would require experience with github, and some html/javascript.
* I haven't given this talk previously, but did give a similar one last year: [Fosdem Archive](https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/js_teaching_tool/),  [slide-show and write-up](https://github.com/janke-learning/fosdem-2019)
* I am comfortable presenting a talk in French or English, whichever will be most appealing.  but the workshop would be difficult to in french since all of the materials already exist and are in English
  * I have previously presented in French at Sett-Namur, though this though was not recorded: [slides](https://blocks-to-text.github.io/sett-namur-19) (french), [write-up](https://github.com/blocks-to-text/top) (english).  And will present again this year - [Un pas d'avance](https://www.sett-namur.be/activity/apprentissage-de-la-programmation-toujours-avoir-un-pas-davance/), [Inclure l'informatiques](https://www.sett-namur.be/activity/inclure-linformatique-dans-toutes-les-disciplines-trucs-et-astuces/)
  * And also gave a small talk in French on Open Source Software for educators at [EduCode](https://www.educode.be/en/): [slides here](https://colevanderswands.github.io/educode-19), but no write-up for this one
* Personal credentials: I've been learning how to use open-source/github to run coding classes for over 3 years
* There would be no exceptional technical requirements. Just a browser & wifi, slides and examples/demos will all be live web-sites
